This includes the ***REMOVED*** website, Payment Micro-site or Common Payment Services (CPS). <\/p><p>The Transport Agency is required by VISA and our Bank to maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry - Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS). These products sit within the Transport Agencies PCI-DSS environment. Any changes to this environment will require validation against the current PCI-DSS requirements to ensure no compliance obligations are being compromised. At the end of this questionnaire a PCI-DSS assessment task will be created. This task will ask you to go through each of the PCI-DSS requirements and ensure they're being met within this product integration.<\/p>",
